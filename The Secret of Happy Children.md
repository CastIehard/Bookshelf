## Key Takeaways
1. You become what you're told. If parents always say you're lazy, you'll become lazy.
2. If children hear things like, "You're good for nothing," they'll become adults who believe, "I can't do it."
3. It's better to say, "I'm angry with you and want you to clean your room right now," instead of "You're a terrible child."
4. If you're not in the mood to be loving, you don't have to pretend because children will notice and get confused or learn to hide their true feelings. Children need to understand that adults have bad days too.
5. Everything you experience is stored in your memory, even if you can't recall it. Be mindful of what you say and how. Children understand arguments or conversations even while sleeping.
6. Use point 5 positively; talk about your children within earshot, so they feel loved and valued.
7. Avoid diminutives as they belittle the child and make them feel small.
8. It's as important to take care of yourself as it is to care for your child. You are their first role model; if you don't manage your diet, exercise, sleep, etc., they won't learn to either.
9. Threats like, "If you do that, Santa will cut off your head," make children think the world is very dangerous or that they can't take their parents seriously.
10. Children need boredom to find themselves and learn. The most creative ideas come from boredom. Constant activity isn't good, nor is a cluttered room; children need space to develop.
11. Children need time alone to recover and process. This time should be respected under all circumstances. If you expect the child to respect your need for personal time, you must respect theirs.
12. Parents must give children a realistic view of the world. When they get older and realize they were lied to, they'll lose trust.
13. Formulations are better without "not" or "no." For example, "Don't run into the street" is worse than "Stay on the sidewalk." Or "Don't fall off the tree" is worse than "Hold on tight."
14. Children need love and affection to develop well. This includes physical contact from 2-3 people, rocking back and forth, and a colorful, cheerful environment.
15. Children need something interesting to occupy themselves. Otherwise, they'll find something on their own, like fighting, because they're bored.
16. Children would rather endure something unpleasant than experience nothing at all.
17. Talk a lot with children, even when they are in the womb. They listen and get used to deeper male voices, which helps later in comforting and in their language development. Intelligence in children is often measured by articulation; if they don't speak, they're seen as less intelligent, treated that way, and thus become less intelligent.
18. Starting projects with children isn't recommended because they won't finish them. This is frustrating and teaches them they can't do it. It's better to see the journey as the goal. For example, teaching them to ride a bike without a set goal in mind.
19. Handling children's problems: Solving problems for them or lecturing isn't helpful long-term. "I told you so..." or "It's your own fault..." isn't helpful. It's better to actively listen, ask questions, and guide them to solve the problem themselves, making them feel like they came up with the solution.
20. Anger is important for standing up for oneself in certain situations. Teach children to express anger in words, not actions.
21. Tears aren't bad; endorphins are released, blocking pain receptors. This is why you feel better after crying. Children shouldn't be stopped from crying; it's a sign they feel safe.
22. Dealing with a tantrum: These scenes happen when children learn they can get what they want through such behavior because it's embarrassing for adults. Never give in to a tantrum. Explain the proper behavior and show through consequences that it isn't acceptable. Most children try this tactic 2-3 times before stopping.
23. Guilt-tripping a child isn't helpful and will be exploited to get what they want.
24. Forcing children into social interactions is important if they don't initiate them. For example, making them say "Hello Grandpa" or "Hello Aunt" is crucial for their social development. Under four years old, this is enough; otherwise, they may become very shy and have social problems later in life.
25. The happiest and strongest children have strong, predictable parents who set clear boundaries within which the children can freely develop. They know they're loved and can rely on their parents in difficult situations.
26. Like wolves in a pack or dogs, children need rules and a hierarchy to feel secure. This builds trust in the parents' competence and decisions, so children don't have to question everything.
27. Guidelines for good parenting: I'm as important as the rest of the family. Children are important but must adapt to others. Even when tired, I must show who's the boss.
28. You don't always need to justify or give in. For example, if the child needs to clean their room, simply repeat the demand without reasons or aggression. The trick is not to give in.
29. Many parents fear conflict and give small children too much freedom. "Would you like to clean your room sometime?" --> No, of course, the child doesn't want to. "Please clean your room by tonight." Without "please" or pleading. It's important because the child learns they don't have to follow rules otherwise.
30. Parents must support each other and accept the partner's opinion in front of the children. Disagreements shouldn't be aired in front of the children. This is crucial because children will learn to play parents against each other otherwise. "If Mom says no, I'll ask Dad."
31. Involve children in household tasks. It's good for them and the parents. Children learn they need to contribute, which helps them manage their lives later.
32. The family environment is very important. The harmony of grandparents, aunts, uncles, friends, etc., is crucial for children's development. They learn to rely on others and help others, which is vital for their social development.
33. An expert found the best sex education is when Dad playfully slaps Mom's butt and Mom enjoys it. Children learn the importance of intimacy in a relationship through this. Kissing, hugging, etc., are important as the parents' relationship is the first one children see and take as a model.
34. The relationship between parents is as important as the relationship with the children. If parents don't love each other, children will notice, leading to problems.
35. Never tolerate children playing parents against each other or disrupting their intimacy out of jealousy. This shows they have too much power, which isn't good. Children must learn they aren't always the center of attention and sometimes need to wait. Otherwise, the parents' relationship suffers, which isn't good for the children.
36. Children are happier with single parents than with parents who fight. Children don't need both a father and mother but a loving environment. Fighting parents cause children to suffer, which isn't good. Children need a loving environment, which is the most important.
37. It's not disturbing for children if parents take an hour for themselves, and strange noises or music come from the room. It's good because children learn parents need time for themselves.
38. Ten minutes daily to save a marriage: Right after coming home, take time for each other and ask how the day was. Maybe have some nuts or a glass of wine. Nothing should interrupt this time. This is crucial because the parents' relationship is the most important for the children.
39. Always remember: THE CHILDREN WILL BE GONE AFTER 18 YEARS, THE PARTNER STAYS.
40. The annoying high-pitched voice some adults have is learned through whining and getting what they want. As adults, it doesn't work, and they end up with an irritating voice that annoys everyone.
41. Tips to prevent parental burnout: Hire a babysitter, actively spend time with the child, and then leave instead of being half-heartedly present all the time. Cook what you like, not what the child wants, play your own music, do adult activities without children, accept that a spotless house isn't possible for ten years.
42. Priority list: 1. Take care of yourself 2. Take care of the relationship 3. Take care of the children. Any other order won't work. If you neglect yourself, the relationship won't work; if the relationship doesn't work, the children suffer.
43. Saying no quietly: Yelling doesn't help. Speak quietly; children will want to know what you say and will get quieter. Otherwise, the volume just escalates.
