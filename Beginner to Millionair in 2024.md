## Key Takeaways
1. A business is like a vehicle (e.g., a race car), and whether it reaches the goal depends solely on the driver. A business is an extension of its people, and if it fails, it’s entirely due to the individual, not the business model. Therefore, the first crucial step is to take responsibility.
2. To earn people’s hard-earned money, you must solve a problem; value is created where pain is alleviated.
3. It’s not about the business; it’s about you. If you are the problem, work on yourself to become the person capable of making $1 million a year or $10k a month.
4. Learn the skills needed to earn significant income. Watch podcasts and identify the skills of successful people in your desired field, make a list, and work on developing those skills.
5. Be willing to change your character to become someone who can achieve your goal. If you’re not willing to sacrifice your character for your goal, you are sacrificing your goal.
