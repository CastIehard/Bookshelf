## Key Takeaways
1.  The slow pace of transformation makes it easy to let a bad habit slide. For example, if you eat a cookie every day, you won't notice much difference in your weight or health for a while. But over time, those small choices add up to big results.
2. A small 1% change wont make a change in the short term, but in the long term it makes the difference between who you are and who you could be.
3. Progress is not linear. It's easy to get discouraged when you don't see immediate results, but change takes time. Keep going, and you'll get there.
4. "When nothing seems to help, I go and look at a stonecutter hammering away at his rock perhaps a hundred times without as much as a crack showing in it. Yet at the hundred and first blow it will split in two, and I know it was not that blow that did it, but all that had gone before." - Jacob Riis
5. Every Olympian wants to win a gold medal. But if successful and unsuccessful people share the same goals, then the goal cannot be what differentiates the winners from the losers. The goal is not what you want to achieve, it's what you want to become.
6. You need to fall in love with the process rather than the product.
7. You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems.
8. Two people resist a cigarette. One says, "I can't smoke. I'm trying to quit." The other says, "I'm not a smoker." The first person is fighting against her desires. The second person has changed her identity. She no longer sees herself as a smoker, so she doesn't need to smoke.
9. You mights start a habit because of motivation, but you'll only continue it because it becomes part of your identity.
10. The goal is not to read a book, the goal is to become a reader. The goal is not to run a marathon, the goal is to become a runner. The goal is not to learn an instrument, the goal is to become a musician.
11. You are acting like the person you believe yourself to be.
12.  You only believe in habits and parts of your identity that you have evidence for. If you go to the gym for 5 years, you believe you are a gym person. If you write for 5 years, you believe you are a writer.
13. Go onto questions like this: "What would a healthy person do?" "What would a successful person do?" "What would a person who is the best in the world at this do?" Then over time, you will become that person.
14. Create a new Habit: 1. Make it obvious. 2. Make it attractive. 3. Make it easy. 4. Make it satisfying.
15. Break a bad habit: 1. Make it invisible. 2. Make it unattractive. 3. Make it difficult. 4. Make it unsatisfying.
16. Rate Habits: "Does this behavior help me become the type of person I wish to be? Does this habit cast a vote for or against my desired identity?"
17. When situation X happens, I will perform response Y.
18. The Diderot Effect: The tendency for one purchase to lead to another. The solution is to buy things for their usefulness rather than their status. Example: Buy new Desk -> Buy new computer -> Buy new chair -> Buy new lamp -> Buy new rug -> Buy new bookshelf -> Buy new books.
19. Habit Stacking: After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [NEW HABIT].
20. If you want to make Habit a big part of your life. Make the cue a big part of your life.
21. People who seemed to have more self-control were actually just better at structuring their lives in a way that did not require heroic willpower and self-control. For example they dont even have sweets in their house.
22. Behavours are attractive when they help us fit in. We are motivated to fit in with the culture we live in. --> Join a group where the desired behavior is the normal behavior. --> Sourround yourself with people who have the habits you want to have.
23. Always when you do something you dont really want to smoke a cigarette or binge eat. You only crave the feeling of relief that comes from the habit. You dont crave the habit itself.
24. Forcing to stick with a energy taking and hard habit is like crankjing uo the water flow when the pipe is clogged. You need to remove the clog first. Which means you need to make the habit easier.
25. Use the art of showing up. Better start with 1 min of running and become a runner than not starting at all.
26. The brain is wired to prioritize immediate rewards over delayed rewards. The solution is to make the immediate rewards of good habits greater than the immediate rewards of bad habits.Thats also why you cant trust the future you.
27. Get a habittracker. It will help you to see your progress and keep you motivated. A calendar is a visual representation of your habits. Just cross out the day when you did the habit.
28. Never miss twice. If you miss a habit once, try to get back on track as soon as possible. Missing once is an accident. Missing twice is the start of a new habit.
29. The problem is not slipping but thinking if you cant do it perfectly you shouldnt do it at all.
30. Get an accountability partner. It will help you to stay on track.
31. Boiling water makes an egg hard and a potato soft. You cant decide wether your hard or soft but you can play a game where its better to be hard or soft.
32. If the outcome becomes expected the habit becomes boring. The human brain is wired to get a dopamine hit from the unexpected. Thats why you need to change your habits from time to time. But some habits are boring and thats okay. You dont need to be entertained all the time.
33. When you start Habits, start a business or start going to the gym you will have days where you dont want to show up. But the difference between a professional and an amateur is that the professional shows up every day.
34. Happiness is simple the absence of desire.
35. Beeing poor is not having too little but wanting more. The same is true for habits. You dont need to have more habits but to want more habits.
