4. Fear and desire are the main reasons people remain poor. They fear taking risks and prefer a secure 40-hour job. Their desires lead them to buy things they can’t afford, causing them to work more.
5. Money is an idea that only works because we all believe in it.
6. Financial intelligence is the ability to earn, save, invest, and donate money. It’s essential in all life areas and is the foundation of wealth. Without it, it’s like building the Burj Khalifa without a foundation.

8. The rich don’t keep their money in savings accounts; they invest in assets like stocks, real estate, and businesses.
9. People spend as much money as they have. As income increases, so does lifestyle, leading back to square one.

19. In the real world, it’s often the bold who succeed, not the smartest.
20. JOB stands for “Just Over Broke.” It’s trading time for money.
21. Employees work just hard enough not to get fired, and employers pay just enough to keep employees from quitting.
