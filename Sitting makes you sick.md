## Key Takeaways
1. **Deep Squats**: The best exercise for stretching the right muscles and fibers and opening up the spinal canal. In Asia, people who sit and work in this position daily rarely suffer from slipped discs or chronic back pain.
2. **Movement**: Constant movement is natural for humans. Not all children have ADHD; many just need to move because their bodies know that sitting still all day is harmful.
3. **High Heels**: They are detrimental because they shorten the Achilles tendon and cause various problems.
4. **European Cramphock**: Working in this position is bad for knee joints and the back and does not stretch the Achilles tendon properly.
5. **Psoas Major Muscle**: Prolonged sitting shortens this muscle, causing the body to lean forward when standing, resulting in an arched back and subsequent back pain.
6. **Modern Toilets**: "Sitting toilets" increase blood pressure, leading to heart attacks, and cause pelvic floor issues, nerve pressure, hemorrhoids, and appendicitis. The solution is to use a squatting position, as practiced in India.
7. **Activity and Stretching**: Alternating between sitting and standing, walking as much as possible, stretching hips, wrists, and shoulders, and staying active are crucial.
