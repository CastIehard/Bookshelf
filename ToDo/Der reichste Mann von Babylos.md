5. If I set out to walk over the bridge into town for a hundred days, picking up a stone each time and throwing it into the river, I would do it. If on the seventh day I passed by without remembering, I wouldn't say to myself: Tomorrow I'll throw two stones into the river. It amounts to the same thing. Instead, I would go back the same way and throw the stone into the river. Nor would I say on the twentieth day: Arkad, this is pointless. What good does it do you to throw a stone into the river every day? Throw a handful in, and be done with it. No, I would neither say nor do that. If I undertake a task, I complete it. That's why I make sure not to take on difficult and impractical tasks, because my comfort is paramount to me.
