### Key Takeaways
1. When a young man seeks the advice of an old man, he receives the wisdom of age. Too often, however, the young believe that older people have only the wisdom of the past and therefore do not benefit from it. But remember: the sun that shines today is the same sun that shone on the day your father was born, and it will still be shining when your last grandson passes into darkness.
2. Every coin is a slave working for you. Every penny is a child working for you.
3. If you want to buy jewellery, go to the jeweller, not to the shepherd.
4. Advice is given for free; be careful what advice you take.
5. If I set out to walk across the bridge into the city for a hundred days, picking up a stone each time and throwing it into the river, I would do it. If on the seventh day I passed by without remembering, I wouldn't say to myself: Tomorrow I'll throw two stones into the river. It is the same thing. Instead, I would go back the same way and throw the stone into the river. Nor would I say on the twentieth day: Arkad, this is useless. What is the use of throwing a stone into the river every day? Throw a handful and be done with it. No, I would neither say nor do that. If I set myself a task, I finish it. That's why I make sure I don't take on difficult and impractical tasks, because my comfort comes first.
6. Save 1/10 of your income and invest it.
7. Don't confuse your needs with your wants. You can always spend as much as you have.
8. Happiness waits for the one who is brave enough to take it.
9. When a hungry dog is fed, it forgets that it was hungry before and walks around like a king, forgetting that tomorrow will come.
10. If you want to help a friend, do it, but don't take the burden on yourself.
11. Don't be fooled by people who have found a way to make easy money.
12. Just as a city cannot withstand war without walls, so we cannot live without good protection.
