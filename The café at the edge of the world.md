## Key messages
1. always do what you want and what fits your purpose.
2. find the ZTE (purpose of existence) and only do things that lead you there. 
3. you can spend a lot of energy and time on things that have nothing to do with your ZTE. But then you have no more energy and time for it.
4. if you spend 20 minutes a day on something unnecessary, that's 1 year lost after graduation until you retire
5. we go to work to be able to afford things we don't need
6. vicious circle of consumption: buy more > more bills > more work > more unfulfilment > more search for fulfilment in objects > buy more
7. our task is to find something that fulfils us because we feel it ourselves and not because someone tells us to or we get it suggested to us by advertising etc.
8. people are afraid of death because they know that from then on they will no longer have time to do the things they always wanted to do.
9. every now and then you should just take time to work on your ZTE and think about it.
