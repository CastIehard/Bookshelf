## Key Takeaways
1. always do what you want and what suits your purpose.
2. find ZTE (purpose of existence) and only do things that lead you there. 
3. you can spend a lot of energy and time on things that have nothing to do with your ZTE. But then you have no energy and time left for it.
4. if you spend 20 minutes a day doing something that is unnecessary, that's 1 year lost after graduation until retirement
5. we go to work to be able to afford things we don't need
6. vicious circle of consumption: buy more > more bills > more work > more unfulfilled > more search for fulfilment in objects > more buying
7. our task is to find something that fulfils us because we feel it ourselves and not because someone says it to us or we get it suggested to us from advertising etc.
8. people are afraid of death because they know that from then on they will no longer have time to do the things they always wanted to do.
9. every now and then you should just take time to edit and think about your ZTE.
