### Key Takeaways
1. When a young man seeks the advice of an old man, he is given the wisdom of age. But all too often, the young believe that older people only possess the wisdom of the past and therefore do not benefit from them. But remember: the sun that shines today is the same one that shone on the day your father was born, and it will still be shining when your last grandson passes into the darkness.
2. Every coin is a slave that works for you. Every penny it makes is a child that also works for you.
3. If you want to buy jewelry, go to the jeweler, not the shepherd.
4. Advice is given for free; be cautious about which advice you take.
5. If I set out to walk over the bridge into town for a hundred days, picking up a stone each time and throwing it into the river, I would do it. If on the seventh day I passed by without remembering, I wouldn't say to myself: Tomorrow I'll throw two stones into the river. It amounts to the same thing. Instead, I would go back the same way and throw the stone into the river. Nor would I say on the twentieth day: Arkad, this is pointless. What good does it do you to throw a stone into the river every day? Throw a handful in, and be done with it. No, I would neither say nor do that. If I undertake a task, I complete it. That's why I make sure not to take on difficult and impractical tasks, because my comfort is paramount to me.
6. Save 1/10 of your earnings and invest it.
7. Don't mistake your needed goods with your wishes. You can always spend as much as you have.
8. Luck waits for the one who is courageous enough to take it.
9. When a hungry dog is fed, he forgets he was hungry before and walks around like a king, forgetting tomorrow will come.
10. If you want to help a friend, do it, but don't take the burden on yourself.
11. Don't let yourself be fooled by people who found a way to make easy money.
12. Like a city cannot withstand war without walls, we cannot live without good protection.
