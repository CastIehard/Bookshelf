## Key Takeaways
1. Don't criticise or complain. Don't speak ill of anyone.
2. Appreciation has great power. Appreciate good work, help and honest people AND show it.
3. Personally, I like chocolate, but when I'm trying to catch a dog, I don't think about what I like, I think about what the dog likes. And that is how I get him to come to me...
4. Always think about what the other person gets out of the thing you want and tell them exactly that.
5. Make them think it's their idea. That way they are more likely to do it.
6. You will make more friends by being interested in people than by trying to be interesting to people.
7. People like to hear themselves talk.
8. A person's name is the sweetest and most important sound in any language for that person.
9. You must have a good time with people if you expect them to have a good time with you.
10. But it can't be bought, begged, borrowed or stolen, for it is something that is of no earthly value to anyone until it is given. Smile.
11. For no one needs a smile more than those who have none to give.
12. Be a good listener. Encourage people to talk about themselves.
13. Make the other person feel important and be honest.
14. You can't win an argument: A man who is convinced against his will is still of the same opinion.
15. When one shouts, the other listens. For when two shout, there is no communication
16. Steps in an argument: Distrust instinct > Control temper > Listen > Seek agreement > Think about other opinion > Thank other person > Postpone if necessary
17. People need to be taught as if you had not taught them. And things unknown proposed as things forgotten.
18. Never say "you are wrong", show respect that the other person has also thought about it.
19. Let the other person save face. Keep mistakes small and the solution simple
20. If nothing works, throw up a challenge
21. Give them a good reputation to live up to: "I'm asking you because you were such a good friend in the past..." Then the other person will want to live up to that standard.
