## Key Takeaways
1. **Live Life Fully**: If you could live your life over, try to make more mistakes. Don't strive for perfection; relax more, watch more sunsets, travel more, climb more mountains, swim in more rivers. No one on their deathbed ever said, "I wish I had spent more time at the office."
2. **Go Slow**: If you're in a hurry, go slowly. If you're in a real rush, take a detour.
3. **Till Eulenspiegel's Lesson**: On his way to Karlsruhe, Till was overtaken by a fast carriage that asked how long it would take to get to Karlsruhe. Till replied, "If you're in a hurry, go slowly." The carriage rushed off, and later Till found it in a ditch. He asked, "Are you in a hurry?"
4. **Patience with Growth**: You can pull on an olive as much as you want, but it won't ripen faster.
5. **Hurry Sickness**: The belief that doing everything faster will enable you to accomplish everything.
6. **Comprehensive Calendar**: A must-have for managing your time effectively.
7. **Enhance Life**: You can't add more days to life, but you can add more life to your days.
8. **Dosage Matters**: Whether something is a poison or a medicine depends on the dose.
9. **Vision for Motivation**: If you want to build a ship, don't gather people to collect wood, assign tasks, and divide work; instead, teach them to long for the endless sea, and the ship will build itself. A company needs a vision.
10. **Purpose of Work**: Question if the purpose of life is to wake up at 5 AM and come home at 6 PM if you don't enjoy your work.
11. **Roles in Life**: Every role we play is a hat we wear. Sometimes we forget we're wearing the hat and think we are the hat. Some hats no longer fit us, and we should take them off.
12. **Priorities Management**: Good time management is simply good priorities management.
13. **Importance vs. Urgency**: We often do urgent things but not always the important ones. To achieve long-term goals, focus on important tasks.
