## Key Takeaways
1. "Is today a good museum day?"
Imagine a museum opens at the end of your life that you can enter before you die. If you spend 80% of your time in a job you hate, then 80% of your pictures will be of that job. If you only spend 2% with your loved ones, then only 2% of the pictures will be of them. Organise your life so that you end up walking happily through your museum. 
2. life is a journey, some people travel with you others only come along for parts of it.
3. the work should be in line with the ZTE, otherwise you can't reach the ZTE > Start your own company and make your own ZTE that of the company.
4. if we repeat the same words over and over again, our minds eventually believe them to be true.
5. if managers don't help their employees achieve their Big 5 or ZTE, what are they doing? They are taking the lives of employees in exchange for money.
6. good leadership is like a papaya plantation. You take the seeds and plant them in high quality soil. You don't use inferior soil because the seeds won't grow. You don't trample on the seeds, you don't water them with salt water and you don't cut them. The result is a plantation with healthy trees and lots of fruit. The success comes from the potential of the seeds and good care together.
7. the secretary who answers the phone is the "director of first impressions" and therefore has an important role in the company, as all potential customers speak to her first.
8. meal vouchers so that employees can invite our business partners to restaurants.
9. every employee is allowed to read during their working hours if they have time. Books of any kind that help him personally or his project.
10. costs + effort < output e.g. for books. 20â‚¬ per year for the books but the employees work more effectively due to the content, have better ideas, make better decisions etc. so the output is greater.
11. 95% have a world trip in their Big 5. Why not set up a travel agency in the company and reward good performance with vouchers, for example?
