## Key Takeaways
1. Emotional intelligence is to regonise an emotion and notice it, but not become it.
2. Battles used to be fought with weapons. Now with words
3. Different types of people want to be talked to in different ways. One group wants facts, another wants small talk, etc.
4. If someone puts you down with words once and you don't fight back, it will happen again.
5. Manipulation works with fear. If someone wants to manipulate someone, they will succeed twice as often with fear.
6. Listening is important in a conversation. The aim should be to understand what the other person is trying to say.
7. Placebo works: Two groups are told to imagine they're professors and footballers, then do the test. Group 1 had 28% more correct answers.
8. Give the hand you take the arm. Agree to do something "once" and then "never again".
9. If you want something, first ask for something much bigger, then if other person refuses, ask for original thing
10. Argument for someone to say: "Everyone has done it that way": "I'm a bit surprised that you are referring to the majority. Have you run out of arguments?" or "Is the earth a plate because the majority thought so for thousands of years?
 as its shallowest point" or "Not everyone who climbs high mountains is therefore an eagle".
11. "Please come down to our level!" or "Please come down to our level!"
12. The other person is distracting from the main topic with some "side issue" --> ignore it or say "Let's stick to the main topic".
13. IF THEN Arguments catch the brain. Stay sympathetic if they make sense
14. Single case argument: Someone uses a really unlikely situation as an argument.
15. In discussions, take a step back and think about what you can learn about the other person.
16. The person who has to justify seems unprofessional
17. Quotes to say after an insult to confuse the other person: "A river is only as deep as its shallowest part" or "Not everyone who climbs high mountains is therefore an eagle".
18. Insult the counterpart: "Interesting that you should say that to me" and when they ask what you mean say "Think about it, you will know" or "Everyone else in the room knows what I mean".
19. When someone gives limited options, say that there are more then them
20. You can only be responsible for your own happiness. If you depend on someone else, it causes problems.
