## Key Takeaways
1. Deep squats are the best you can do. It stretches the right muscles and fibres and opens up the spinal canal. People in Asia sit and work like this every day and they don't have slipped discs or chronic back pain.
2. Moving around a lot is human and normal. Not all children have ADHS, they just want to move naturally because their bodies know that sitting still all day is bad for them.
3. High heels are really bad because they shorten the Achilles tendon and cause more problems.
4. Working in the European cramphock is bad for the knee joints, back and does not stretch the Achilles tendon properly.
5. Sitting for a long time shortens a muscle called the psoas major, which causes the body to move forward when you stand up, resulting in a arched back which then causes back pain.
6. Modern "sitting toilets" are bad both for blood pressure and cause heart attacks, and for the pelvic floor causing nerve pressure, haemorrhoids and appendicitis --> solution is to shit in a squatting position like in India.
7. Switching between sitting and standing, walking around as much as possible, stretching the hips, wrists and shoulders and staying active is key.
